# Video-based-Dynamic-Human-Authentication-System-for-access-control-using-Face-Recognition-module
Though there exists a technology for face recognition based authentication,dynamic human recognition based authentication is highly challenging. This project identifies every unique person who enters or exit the gate, with log of all previous entry/exit time, photos recorded. That means if there is no previous history of an individual on the first entry. The system will immediately alert the security if it is a new person and the security will decide to allow/restrict that person entering inside the premises. Whereas, the system will learn from its previous history of videos/images dynamically to allow a known person.
